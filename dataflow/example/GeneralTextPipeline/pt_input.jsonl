{"raw_content": "Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy. The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four laws of thermodynamics. These laws convey a quantitative description using measurable macroscopic physical quantities."}
{"raw_content": "Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions that convert biochemical energy into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process takes place in the cells of organisms. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic, breaking large molecules into smaller ones and releasing energy."}
{"raw_content": "A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data. It allows searches, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. This structure is well suited for storage systems that read and write large blocks of data, such as databases and file systems."}
{"raw_content": "Plate tectonics is the scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of Earth's lithosphere. The lithosphere is broken into seven large plates and numerous smaller plates. This process explains the formation of mountain ranges, the distribution of continents, and the occurrence of earthquakes."}
